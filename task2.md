You are working in a C# project. Your task is to generate a comprehensive markdown documentation file for the NotificationService class, following the structure and style of the provided documentation example (DocumentConversionService API).

The documentation should include:
- YAML front matter with title, version, and date
- Overview section explaining the service's purpose and capabilities
- API Reference table listing all public methods with descriptions and return types
- Examples section with:
 -- C# usage examples for each method
 -- cURL example for one method
 -- Sample JSON response
- Error Codes table
- Notes section about the documentation structure

Key requirements:
- Follow the exact structure of the DocumentConversionService example
- Use proper markdown formatting for code blocks (csharp, bash, json)
- Include tables for API reference and error codes
- Reference the NotificationResult model and its properties
- Make the documentation self-contained
- Match the level of detail from the example

Focus on these methods:

- SendEmailAsync
- SendSmsAsync
- SendPushAsync

Include details about:
- Required parameters for each method
- The NotificationResult return type
- Error handling cases
- Configuration requirements (SMTP, Twilio, Firebase)

The documentation should be ready to use - complete with all sections, properly formatted, and following the example's style exactly. Provide the full markdown content that can be copied directly into a .md file.
